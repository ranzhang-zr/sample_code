# sample_code
Sample scripts of the projects I've worked in during research internship (NofA lab).


Contaning data cleaning (SI and SRL project) and basic statistical analyses (SI project).
I managed to write these in a short timeframe, and although it's still not clean/perfect enough, it functioned as we needed.
And I plan to further enhance my programming skill in the future, for I enjoy the process.
